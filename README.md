# STM32F405R_Cooling_Control

Main radiator cooling control MCU, STM32F405R, of Clover.

Forked from HAN's main radiator cooling control, authored by ÍπÄÏÑ∏ÏõÖ.

While the code mostly remains the same, this fork aims to...

1. Accommodate updated pinmap.
- The previous repository consists abnormal .ioc pinmap configuration, due to design errors on the circuit discovered after tape-in.
- The circuit mostly remains the same, but the errors mentioned above are fixed, and therefore hardware schematic regarding the pinmap has been updated.
2. Reconfigure DMA settings.
- So that the board can read more than 8 ADC channels.
